This is my personal website. I want it to contain more information about the different projects I've done. This is supposed to be an unrestricted portfolio sort of. Future ideas are in the issues section on Github. 

Currently only uses jquery on the front end and the backend is running an express js server.

To start the server:

``` shell
$ node server.js
```
